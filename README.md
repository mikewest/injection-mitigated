# An `[InjectionMitigated]` IDL Attribute

This repo contains a monkey-patch spec that sketches an IDL attribute that limits
the exposure of IDL constructs to contexts that sufficiently mitigate the risk of
injection attacks. Perhaps you have opinions about that kind of thing?

Read the spec at <https://mikewest.github.io/injection-mitigated/>.

Thanks!
